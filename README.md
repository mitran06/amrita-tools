# Hey fellow dev! Welcome to **Amrita Tools**
Amrita Tools is a collection of reusable scripts, components, and other utilities made to primarily encourage the development of applications for our university and to avoid reinventing the wheel.
I made this in hopes that it would save time and effort for anyone developing Amrita-related applications.

Feel free to contribute anything you feel others would find useful (ref. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md))
